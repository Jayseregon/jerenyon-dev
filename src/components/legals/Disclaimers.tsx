          The quotes generated through this tool are estimates only and are
          intended to provide a preliminary understanding of potential project
          costs.

        <li>
          The subtotals and grand total displayed in this tool reflect estimated
          pricing based on selected features, services, and configurations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The generated quote is valid for 30 days from the date it was created

        <li>
          By submitting the quote through the provided form, you agree to be
          contacted for a preliminary consultation session. This session is
          intended to clarify your project&apos;s details, finalize the scope,
          and establish the final pricing. No binding agreement will be made
          until a formal proposal and contract are signed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The final cost will be determined after a complete project scope
          definition and agreement, taking into account any additional
          requirements or adjustments to the scope.
